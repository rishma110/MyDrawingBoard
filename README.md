# MyDrawingBoard

1. This is a simple drawing board app that lets you use a pen and a marker.
2. The pen has three sizes which lets you draw strokes of three different thicknesses (1px,3px,5px)
3. Then we have a marker that lets you draw highlighted strokes with opacity 50% that means you would be able to see pen strokes that you made behind it.
4. The highlighter strokes are removed automatically once we make a new stroke with either a highlighter or a pen or an eraser.
5. We also have an eraser which erases the previously made strokes made by a pen.
6. We finally have a color palatte with 10 different colors. Selecting on these would change the color of the tool(pen/marker) that you are currently using.
